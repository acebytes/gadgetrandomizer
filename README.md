# Gadget randomizer
### Made with React + Redux

* Fetches a random cheap gadget from AliExpress (because who doesn't love cheap stuff)
* Provides a list of the items you have already viewed
* Option to favorite the best items
* Saves your lists to localstorage so your session doesn't get nuked every time you close the browser
